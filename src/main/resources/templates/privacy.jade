                                            |in developing web-applications. With the help of modern technologies (such as
                                            |Spring 5 and Bootstrap 4) implementing main functionality wasn’t very complicated,
                                            |but web-pages design was a challenge. In that moment project name that was chosen
                                            |at the very beginning inspired me to present Windows kernels as planets cores,
                                            |because, as you know, Earth’s core is extremely hot and located so deeply that
                                            |obviously reminds Hell. And here “Vergilius” comes to help.

                                            |My main profile is C/C++ system programming including Windows drivers. I saw a
                                            |similar project on the web but it was outdated and abandoned however it was still
                                            |helpful. So I decided to create a better one. Luckily I've got Svitlana just
                                            |graduated so I've gave her an idea for her portfolio project.
